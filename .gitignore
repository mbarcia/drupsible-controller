# Patterns which are specific to a particular repository but which do not need
# to be shared with other related repositories (e.g., auxiliary files that 
# live inside the repository but are specific to one user's workflow) should 
# go into the $GIT_DIR/info/exclude file.
#
# Another option is to set core.excludesFile to the name of a file containing 
# global patterns.
